# CS homework examples
This is the readme file for all the homeworks where each homeworks details are in its corresponding sub-folder (not including exact class name, so this github hopefully doesn't show up in google searches).

I'm making this public to show more code examples on my github, so there is more code to look at when I apply for a job. All of my homeworks got 100%, so I don't mind showing them as a reference.

If future students find this and all the homework questions are still the same, it's not my problem.

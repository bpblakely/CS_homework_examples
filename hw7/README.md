Task1: running the executable does not work in windows, so I'm compiling it as ghci and calling main

task2: uses list matching to take only values that are divisible by 3

task3: uses mostly the same code from task2, but now checks if x < 0 and then returns the length of that list.

task4: if the parameter is greater than 0, then map the number as a string (show number) to an int 1 at a time. This splits the digits because a string is a list of chars.
